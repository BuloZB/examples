The data\\ngeneration pipeline is detailed in Appendix D.\\n3.2 Encompassing Diverse RLM Architectures\\nThe above-described design is applicable to many RLM\\ndesigns. However, there are numerous other variants of\\narchitectures, some of which do not fully conform to this\\nframework. In this section, we discuss these variants, high-\\nlighting how our blueprint accommodates such variations.\\nIn some RLM designs [169], a single node in the MCTS\\ntree could represent an entire reasoning structure , such as\\na complete chain of reasoning steps. In this case, the ac-\\ntion space involves transitioning between different reason-\\ning structures rather than individual steps. This approach\\nchanges the nature of the search, as the focus shifts from\\niteratively constructing a single reasoning path to evaluating\\nand refining entire structures within the search space. Our\\nblueprint accommodates this with the concept of nesting,\\nwhere a node in the reasoning structure can contain another\\nreasoning structure.\\nOther architectures introduce even more novel\\nparadigms. For instance, Journey Learning [113] adds\\nan additional layer of complexity by incorporating a\\ntransformation step that “rewires” the search or reasoning\\nstructure. This transformation consolidates multiple paths\\nin the tree, synthesizing them into a new form that is used\\nas input for subsequent reasoning iterations.\\nDespite these variations, our blueprint is sufficiently\\ngeneral to encompass all these cases and beyond, as we\\nillustrate more formally in the following. This generality\\nensures that the blueprint is not only applicable to existing\\ndesigns but also provides a foundation for future innova-\\ntions in RLM development.\\n3.3 Integration with Broader LLM Agent Ecosystems\\nThe integration of RLMs into broader LLM agent ecosys-\\ntems would enable these models to interact dynamically\\nwith external tools, databases, and resources during exe-\\ncution. This interaction can occur within the inference or\\ndata generation pipeline, leveraging value or policy models\\nto extend the reasoning process through access to retrieval-\\naugmented generation (RAG), web queries, and specialized\\ntools. For example, during a reasoning task, the value or the\\nreward model could query a database to verify intermediate\\nsteps, ensuring factual correctness or retrieving additional\\ncontext to refine its reasoning. Similarly, these models could\\nutilize computational tools for mathematical or symbolic\\ncomputations, thereby expanding the scope and accuracy\\nof their reasoning.\\n4 B LUEPRINT FOR REASONING LMS\\nWe now introduce our RLM blueprint that can be used to\\ndevelop novel reasoning models and to provide ground for\\nanalysis, evaluation, and comparison of such designs. We\\noverview the blueprint in Figure 5.\\n4.1 Overview & Main Components\\nThe blueprint specifies a toolbox of components that can be\\nused to build an arbitrary RLM. We identify several classes\\nof such components. First, an RLM includes a reasoning\\nscheme, which specifies a reasoning structure (e.g., a tree)\\ntogether with a reasoning strategy (e.g., MCTS) of how\\nthis structure evolves in order to solve a given input task.\\nSecond, there is a set of operators (e.g., Refine) that can\\nbe applied to the reasoning structure (as specified by the\\nreasoning strategy) in order to evolve it and make progress\\ntowards solving the input task. Operators are specified\\nbased on what they do (i.e., what effect they have on the\\nreasoning structure). How this effect is achieved, depends on\\nhow a given operator is implemented. Here, many operators\\nrely on neural models (e.g., Policy Model), which – together\\nwith their training paradigms – form the third class of\\nthe blueprint components. Finally, we also distinguish a\\nset of pipelines, i.e., detailed specifications of operations that\\norchestrate the interaction between the reasoning scheme\\nand the operators in order to achieve a specific objective,\\nsuch as training, inference, or data generation. Hence, an\\nRLM can be defined as a composition of a reasoning scheme, a\\nset of operators and associated models, and a set of pipelines.\\n4.2 Reasoning Scheme\\nA reasoning scheme is the part of the blueprint that specifies\\nthe details of the reasoning steps progressing toward the\\nsolution, how they are interconnected to form coherent\\nchains, trees, or more complex reasoning structures, and\\nhow these structures evolve in the course of solving the\\ninput task.\\n4.2.1 Reasoning Step\\nA reasoning step is a fundamental unit of the reasoning\\nstructure – a sequence of tokens that advances the RLM\\ntowards the solution. Reasoning steps can vary in length,\\nranging from a single token to entire segments of text. The\\nvariability in their granularity depends on the user design\\nchoice. In existing schemes, a reasoning step is typically\\nconceptualized as a “coherent and self-contained unit of\\nthought”. For instance, in mathematical proofs, this may\\ncorrespond to an individual logical argument or deduction.\\nThe flexibility in defining reasoning steps allows mod-\\nels to adapt to different problem domains, balancing fine-\\ngrained and coarse-grained reasoning. Coarse steps, such\\nas logical arguments (or even complete reasoning path-\\nways [169]), simplify preparation and adoption of training\\ndata, enhance interpretability, and – as we discuss in Sec-\\ntion 8 – reduce computational overhead. On the other hand,\\nsingle-token steps enable the utilization of concepts like\\ntoken entropy [96] to incorporate the model’s uncertainty,\\nas well as the integration of advanced decoding schemes\\n(e.g., speculative decoding [77] or contrastive decoding [80])\\nexplicitly into the RLM design. Yet, while making the rea-\\nsoning steps more fine-grained allows for a more detailed\\nexploration of solution paths, this increased flexibility re-\\nsults in greater computational demands, particularly when\\ncombined with search algorithms such as MCTS.', score=0.99754655, reference=PdfReference(type='pdf', pages=[7], file=FileModel(name='2501.11223.pdf', id='1f14e83e-4f8f-4d5c-ace0-226a01fdbaff', metadata={'type': 'paper'}, created_on='2025-01-23T13:19:39.620963343Z', updated_on='2025-01-23T13:20:28.265051503Z', status='Available', percent_done=1.0, signed_url='https://storage.googleapis.com/knowledge-prod-files/2beaa431-2ec0-4489-83b7-166d36e028ea%2F5bcf107f-a9d1-4982-af5c-0708c1147be0%2F1f14e83e-4f8f-4d5c-ace0-226a01fdbaff.pdf?X-Goog-Algorithm=GOOG4-RSA-SHA256&X-Goog-Credential=ke-prod-1%40pc-knowledge-prod.iam.gserviceaccount.com%2F20250123%2Fauto%2Fstorage%2Fgoog4_request&X-Goog-Date=20250123T133607Z&X-Goog-Expires=3600&X-Goog-SignedHeaders=host&response-content-disposition=inline&response-content-type=application%2Fpdf&X-Goog-Signature=87474a3991164fb92f03e66f31cc2e0e787009a37f0a5c0bc8cfd2bb2187fb70b8b12f8cc03eddd5619a784312366308bd38bc25f29b57e0b3f9244bacfeedf422b946ec95cbad5f14f3852c18610aefce06382baa1a8d56336ebe6bda274802ca588d587f03c476d8e24e58e4175422460e661ca4095b1c361feec6f748f6b477909b0437d4f0cb1328aaa82264ec212d25139e39f9b8cc162cc3728301153830b877ffba88b6240aba95feb751b15a36335c6a95fbd2cb5c34390af9e8409ec7ecd87fbcef481ed44d77766e7490aaed3316a344a49bb05266c209b1058200bd118db56667f3a48e43e6cdf03aeb3c84c8e84a2d5971c8e6e63e61987fc62e', error_message=None, size=7964667))), Snippet(type='text', content='2\\nLegend:       start of an era        Supercomputer        CPU/GPU        Model \\n2010 2015 2020 2025\\nHPC\\nRL\\nLLM\\nRLM\\no3\\nx1\\nQwQ\\nv=0.001\\nv=0.08v=0.01 v=0.05 v=0.12\\nv=0.11 v=0.04\\nπ π\\nπ π\\nπ π ππ π\\nv=0.09\\nv=0.01\\nValue model\\n(neural network)\\nPolicy model\\n(neural network)\\nSort the numbers \"3,2,4,5,6,12,5,6\"\\nNumbers are blue\\n\"3,4\" & \"5,2\"Split into two setsQuicksort sorts\\nnumbersPick Pivot \"3,2,4,5\" & \"7,12,5,6\"\\nLook up Quicksort Sor�ng is simple Split into two sets\\nv=0.001\\nv=0.08 v=0.01 v=0.05 v=0.12\\nv=0.11 v=0.04\\nπ π\\nπ π\\nπ\\nπ π\\nπ π\\nv=0.09\\nv=0.01\\nautoregressive\\ntoken generation\\nStart of the\\nPetascale era\\nStart of the\\nExascale era\\nThe ongoing growth of compute power and data processing capabili�es of supercomputers and\\nhigh performance systems, previously driven by Moore\\'s law and now by the massively parallel \\nprocessing capabili�es of GPUs, TPUs, and AI accelerators.\\nTransformer\\nLLM\\nMCTS samples mul�ple tree searches to some depth and propagates ﬁnal values up \\nthe path, which keeps sta�s�cs for each (state, ac�on)-pair (edge).

Emerg-\\ning analyses suggest that their design likely integrates el-\\nements such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) or Beam\\nSearch, reinforcement learning (RL), process-based super-\\nvision (PBS) [83], [83], [143], [143], and advanced in-context\\nlearning (ICL) techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [152]\\nor Tree of Thoughts (ToT) [161], and possibly even retrieval-\\naugmented generation (RAG) [13], [53], [78], [79].\\nAdditionally, these architectures employ multiple spe-\\ncialized subcomponents—such as synthetic data generation\\nengines and policy, value, and reward models—trained\\nthrough some form of novel loss functions and possibly sev-\\neral fine-tuning schemes. However, the intricate interplay of\\nthese components and their integration into a cohesive and\\neffective architecture remains poorly understood. Here, the\\n“holy-grail question” is: what is the detailed design of an RLM\\nand how to make it simultaneously achieve effectiveness (i.e., high\\naccuracy in delivered answers), low cost, and scalability?\\nTo help answer this question and to address the above\\nchallenges, we propose a comprehensive blueprint for\\nconstructing, analyzing, and experimenting with RLMs\\n(contribution #1; a roadmap of all the contributions and the\\npaper is in Figure 1). Our approach identifies and crystal-\\nlizes the fundamental building blocks of RLMs, organizing\\nthem into a cohesive framework. This blueprint is presented\\nwith increasing levels of granularity, starting from high-\\nlevel overview, finishing at low-level details that can be\\ndirectly harnessed when implementing. Further, to max-\\nimize the clarity and comprehensiveness, we present the\\nblueprint using three perspectives: (1) architecture diagrams\\nand descriptions, (2) detailed mathematical formulations,\\nand (3) in-depth algorithmic specifications. By employing\\nthese complementary perspectives, we aim to provide a\\nclear and actionable guide for developing RLMs tailored to\\nspecific applications, settings, and constraints.\\nOur blueprint comprehensively encompasses the poten-\\ntial building blocks of RLMs, offering a flexible and modular\\nframework. It incorporates a variety of reasoning structures,\\nsuch as chains, trees, graphs, and even higher-order struc-\\ntures such as hierarchical (or nested) trees, along with nu-\\nmerous operations that transform and advance the reason-\\ning process. The blueprint supports different granularities\\nof reasoning steps, ranging from individual tokens to full\\nsentences or structured segments.

Y et, their high costs, proprietary nature, and complex architectures—uniquely combining\\nReinforcement Learning (RL), search heuristics, and LLMs—present accessibility and scalability challenges. To address these, we\\npropose a comprehensive blueprint that organizes RLM components into a modular framework, based on a survey and analysis of all\\nRLM works. This blueprint incorporates diverse reasoning structures (chains, trees, graphs, and nested forms), reasoning strategies\\n(e.g., Monte Carlo Tree Search, Beam Search), RL concepts (policy, value models and others), supervision schemes (Outcome-Based\\nand Process-Based Supervision), and other related concepts (e.g., Test-Time Compute, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, agent\\ntools). We also provide detailed mathematical formulations and algorithmic specifications to simplify RLM implementation. By showing\\nhow schemes like LLaMA-Berry, QwQ, Journey Learning, and Graph of Thoughts fit as special cases, we demonstrate the blueprint’s\\nversatility and unifying potential. To illustrate its utility, we introducex1, a modular implementation for rapid RLM prototyping and\\nexperimentation. Using x1 and a literature review, we provide key insights, such as multi-phase training for policy and value models,\\nand the importance of familiar training distributions. Finally, we discuss scalable RLM cloud deployments and we outline how RLMs can\\nintegrate with a broader LLM ecosystem. Our work demystifies RLM construction, democratizes advanced reasoning capabilities, and\\nfosters innovation, aiming to mitigate the gap between “rich AI” and “poor AI” by lowering barriers to RLM development and\\nexperimentation.\\nIndex Terms—Reasoning Language Model, Large Reasoning Model, Survey of Reasoning Language Models, Survey of RLMs, RLM,\\nLRM, Reasoning LLMs, Reinforcement Learning for LLMs, MCTS for LLMs, Large Language Model, LLM, Generative AI.\\n✦\\n1 I NTRODUCTION\\nReasoning Language Models (RLMs), such as OpenAI’s\\no1 [110], o3 [72], and Alibaba’s QwQ [140], also referred\\nto as Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) 1, represent a trans-\\nformative breakthrough in AI, on par with the advent of\\nChatGPT [108]. These advanced systems have fundamen-\\ntally redefined AI’s problem-solving capabilities, enabling\\nnuanced reasoning, improved contextual understanding,\\nand robust decision-making across a wide array of domains.\\nBy extending the capabilities of standard large language\\nmodels (LLMs) with sophisticated reasoning mechanisms,\\n1We use the term “Reasoning Language Model” instead of “Large\\nReasoning Model” because the latter implies that such models are\\nalways large. This does not necessarily have to be the case – as a\\nmatter of fact, smaller RLM can outperform larger LLMs [52].\\nRLMs have emerged as the new cornerstone of cutting-edge\\nAI, bringing us closer to AGI.\\nHowever, the high cost and proprietary nature of state-\\nof-the-art RLMs, such as those developed by OpenAI, risk\\nexacerbating the divide between “rich AI” and “poor AI”,\\nraising significant concerns about accessibility and equity.\\nEven the publicly available QwQ only comes with its model\\nweights, and Alibaba does not disclose details about their\\ntraining or data generation methodologies. Businesses and\\nindividuals unable to afford these advanced systems face a\\ngrowing disadvantage, threatening to stifle innovation and\\nreinforce systemic inequities. As RLMs become integral to\\ncritical applications, from healthcare to science, manage-\\nment, and beyond, it is imperative to address these dis-\\nparities and ensure that the benefits of advanced reasoning\\ncapabilities are broadly accessible.\\narXiv:2501.11223v2  [cs.AI]  22 Jan 2025\", score=0.9967396, reference=PdfReference(type='pdf', pages=[1], file=FileModel(name='2501.11223.pdf', id='1f14e83e-4f8f-4d5c-ace0-226a01fdbaff', metadata={'type': 'paper'}, created_on='2025-01-23T13:19:39.620963343Z', updated_on='2025-01-23T13:20:28.265051503Z', status='Available', percent_done=1.0, signed_url='https://storage.googleapis.com/knowledge-prod-files/2beaa431-2ec0-4489-83b7-166d36e028ea%2F5bcf107f-a9d1-4982-af5c-0708c1147be0%2F1f14e83e-4f8f-4d5c-ace0-226a01fdbaff.pdf?X-Goog-Algorithm=GOOG4-RSA-SHA256&X-Goog-Credential=ke-prod-1%40pc-knowledge-prod.iam.gserviceaccount.com%2F20250123%2Fauto%2Fstorage%2Fgoog4_request&X-Goog-Date=20250123T133607Z&X-Goog-Expires=3600&X-Goog-SignedHeaders=host&response-content-disposition=inline&response-content-type=application%2Fpdf&X-Goog-Signature=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', error_message=None, size=7964667))), Snippet(type='text', content='12\\n4.5 Pipelines\\nA pipeline is a detailed specification of operations that\\norchestrates the details of the interaction between the rea-\\nsoning scheme and the operators and models to achieve a\\nspecific objective. Typically, an RLM would incorporate a\\nsingle pipeline for inference and a separate pipeline for\\ntraining each model used in an RLM. Moreover, there could\\nalso be pipelines for synthetic data generation used for\\ntraining models. One can also distinguish a pipeline that\\ntrains an Implicit RLM using the provided reasoning traces\\nfrom the Explicit RLM.\\nThe details of pipelines depend on arbitrary design\\nchoices. In Section 3, we provided a general description\\nof how these pipelines work. In Appendix C, we present\\ndetailed algorithmic specifications of our pipelines, along\\nwith insights into the reasoning behind these design choices.\\nSpecifically, the inference pipeline can be found in Ap-\\npendix C.1 and in Algorithm 1. Pipelines for different train-\\ning phases and paradigms can be found in Appendix C.2,\\nAppendix C.3, and in Algorithms 2–7. The data generation\\npipeline is detailed in Appendix D.\\n5 E XPRESSING EXISTING SCHEMES\\nWe now showcase the expressivity of our blueprint, by\\nillustrating how it can be used to model a broad scope of\\nexisting RLMs and other related works. We summarize the\\noutcomes of the analysis in Table 1. We start with typical and\\nmost prevalent Explicit RLM architectures based on MCTS\\nand policy and/or value models, where a single reasoning\\nstep is an individual logical argument (Section 5.1). We also\\ndiscuss there schemes that generalize this typical design,\\nby harnessing nesting or Linearization Structure operators.\\nFinally, we study Implicit RLMs (Section 5.2) and various\\nstructured prompting schemes such as Cot or ToT (Sec-\\ntion 5.3), showing that they also fit our blueprint.\\n5.1 Explicit RLMs\\nWe start with the most widespread variant of RLMs that fol-\\nlows the architecture outlined in Section 3.1. These reason-\\ning models such as TS-LLM [45], AlphaLLM [141], MCTS-\\nDPO [155], and others [23], [52], [145], [169], [170], [174]\\ngenerally employ an explicit tree structure in which a node\\nrepresents a distinct reasoning step. The reasoning strategy\\nis based on the MCTS and focuses on iterative exploration,\\nexpansion and evaluation of nodes within the tree. By incor-\\nporating value mechanisms—such as prompt-based evalu-\\nation or dedicated value models, the system identifies and\\nprioritizes promising branches, facilitating more informed\\ndecision-making and refinement of the reasoning process.\\nAll MCTS based reasoning models implement at least a\\nnext-step generation operator, an evaluation operator, and\\nthe update operator for back-propagating the values. In ad-\\ndition, ReST-MCTS*, LLaMA-Berry, and Marco-o1 support a\\nrefinement operator to further improve produced reasoning\\nsteps.\\nJourney Learning [113] exhibits two main differences to\\ntypical MCTS-based RLMs. First, it harnesses the Lineariza-\\ntion Structure operator, in which the tree reasoning structure\\nis transformed into a chain, by extracting several selected\\nreasoning chains from it and combining them together into\\nan individual long chain. This way, the scheme attempts to\\nharness insights from different tree branches. By maintain-\\ning a chain-based structure, Journey Learning preserves the\\nsimplicity of linear reasoning while embedding the capacity\\nfor self-correction and exploration of multiple hypotheses.\\nAdditionally, Journey Learning introduces a pipeline for\\nthe internalization of such long reasoning chains into its\\nweights. This enables the final model to generate such long\\nreasoning chains, possibly containing different reasoning\\nbranches, directly from its weights, making it an implicit\\nRLM.\\n5.2 Implicit RLMs\\nQwens’s QwQ [140] embodies a fully implicit reasoning\\nmodel, characterized by an implicit reasoning structure that\\nis generated autoregressively directly by the model weights.\\nThe reasoning strategy in QwQ – as indicated by the\\nmodel output – harnesses next-step generation, backtrack-\\ning, summarization, and critique generation to derive the\\nfinal solution. At each step, the model implicitly generates a\\nnew node within the chain by employing one of these four\\nimplicit generate operators, presumably implemented using\\nspecial tokens.\\n5.3 Structured Prompting Schemes\\nFinally, we also illustrate that advanced structured prompt-\\ning schemes, such as CoT, ToT, and GoT, constitute a fully\\nexplicit RLM structure without any implicit reasoning than\\nwhat is originally presented in the used LLM, i.e., no models\\nnor training or data generation pipelines.\\nCoT [152] utilizes an implicit reasoning structure con-\\nsisting of a chain of reasoning steps. The reasoning strategy\\nemployed in CoT is oriented towards constructing a single\\ncoherent chain of reasoning, culminating in a solitary solu-\\ntion, thus only needing the generation operator. CoT serves\\nas the foundational framework for a range of advanced rea-\\nsoning strategies, including prompting methodologies such\\nas Self-Consistency and Self-Refinement, among others.\\nSelf-Consistency (SC) [150] extends the CoT frame-\\nwork by introducing redundancy into the reasoning pro-\\ncess. It generates multiple reasoning chains and employs a\\nmajority-voting mechanism to determine the most consis-\\ntent solution, which implements a Select operator from our\\nblueprint.\\nToT [161] adopts an explicit reasoning structure orga-\\nnized in a hierarchical, tree-based format. Within this frame-\\nwork, each node corresponds to a distinct reasoning step,\\nand branching facilitates exploration across multiple infer-\\nential pathways (the Generate operator). Additionally, an\\nevaluation operator, implemented via a specialized prompt\\nand the LLM itself, assesses branches of the tree.\\nGoT [9] introduces a more intricate reasoning structure\\nby employing an explicit graph-based representation. In this\\nframework, nodes represent individual reasoning steps, and\\nthe graph architecture supports non-linear, interdependent\\nrelationships between these steps. The reasoning strategy in\\nGoT is orchestrated by an external controller, realized as a\\nseparate LLM, which guides the exploration, refinement and\\naggregation of the graph’s nodes.', score=0.97257143, reference=PdfReference(type='pdf', pages=[12], file=FileModel(name='2501.11223.pdf', id='1f14e83e-4f8f-4d5c-ace0-226a01fdbaff', metadata={'type': 'paper'}, created_on='2025-01-23T13:19:39.620963343Z', updated_on='2025-01-23T13:20:28.265051503Z', status='Available', percent_done=1.0, signed_url='https://storage.googleapis.com/knowledge-prod-files/2beaa431-2ec0-4489-83b7-166d36e028ea%2F5bcf107f-a9d1-4982-af5c-0708c1147be0%2F1f14e83e-4f8f-4d5c-ace0-226a01fdbaff.pdf?X-Goog-Algorithm=GOOG4-RSA-SHA256&X-Goog-Credential=ke-prod-1%40pc-knowledge-prod.iam.gserviceaccount.com%2F20250123%2Fauto%2Fstorage%2Fgoog4_request&X-Goog-Date=20250123T133607Z&X-Goog-Expires=3600&X-Goog-SignedHeaders=host&response-content-disposition=inline&response-content-type=application%2Fpdf&X-Goog-Signature=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', error_message=None, size=7964667))), Snippet(type='text', content='23\\nquestion formats, enabling a systematic evaluation of rea-\\nsoning capabilities across diverse contexts.\\nARC Challenge [32] assesses the ability to understand\\nformal patterns, rules, and transformations within struc-\\ntured, grid-based environments.

Another line of related benchmarks tests\\nthe RAG capabilites [25], [44], [93], [156].\\n10 R ELATED ANALYSES\\nRLMs have been explored from several angles in prior\\nworks, yet significant gaps remain in providing a systematic\\nblueprint and open-sourced framework for their construc-\\ntion. Below, we categorize prior efforts and describe how\\nour work advances the field.\\n10.1 Reasoning with Standard LLMs\\nSeveral works explore techniques for enhancing the reason-\\ning capabilities of standard LLMs. These approaches use\\nstraightforward mechanisms applied during pre-training,\\nfine-tuning or inference.\\nEnhancing Reasoning with Training Huang and\\nChang [63] outline pre-training and fine-tuning on reason-\\ning datasets, and advanced prompting strategies. Sun et\\nal. [135] contribute additional insights, including techniques\\nsuch as alignment training and the integration of Mixture\\nof Experts architectures. Furthermore, Huang et al. [65]\\ndemonstrate the possibility of self-improvement on reason-\\ning tasks with additional training on self-generated labels.\\nReasoning with Prompting & In-Context Learning\\nQiao et al. [112] provide an overview of prompting-only\\ntechniques, classifying prompting methods into two main\\ncategories: strategy-enhanced reasoning and knowledge-\\nenhanced reasoning. Besta et al. [14] provide a taxonomy\\nof different advanced in-context reasoning topologies. These\\ninclude the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [152], Tree of Thoughts\\n(ToT) [161], and Graph of Thoughts (GoT) [9].\\nSome of these works further provide overviews of dif-\\nferent reasoning tasks, reasoning datasets, and reasoning\\nbenchmarks [63], [112], [135].

By encompassing diverse\\nreasoning structures, operations, and training schemes, the\\nblueprint establishes a robust foundation for constructing,\\nanalyzing, and extending RLMs tailored to various appli-\\ncations. The accompanying x1 implementation enhances\\nthis contribution, offering a modular, minimalist, and user-\\nfriendly platform for experimentation and rapid prototyp-\\ning of novel RLM architectures.\\nOur blueprint and x1 pave the way for several exciting\\navenues of future research and development in reasoning\\nAI. One example is Trace-Based Supervision (TBS), which\\nextends process-based supervision by incorporating labeled\\ntraces of traversal through reasoning structures. TBS has the\\npotential to train more powerful implicit RLMs capable of\\ninternalizing reasoning structures and improving general-\\nization.\\nThe work also explores new directions in value and\\nreward modeling, introducing a hierarchy of models and\\nformally identifying several recent designs as instances of a\\nnew class of models, namely the Outcome-Driven Process\\nReward Model. This model class bridges the gap between\\noutcome-based evaluation and process-based supervision\\nby dynamically connecting intermediate reasoning steps to\\nterminal outcomes, enabling more granular feedback during\\ntraining without the need.\\nAdditionally, the blueprint’s extensive set of operators\\ncan inspire the development of innovative reasoning strate-\\ngies, such as advanced tree-based searches, multi-step re-\\nfinement processes, or hybrid search algorithms that adapt\\ndynamically to the task’s complexity. These strategies can\\nbe tailored using the token probability distribution anal-\\nysis tools provided, leading to more effective generation\\nstrategies that optimize reasoning steps through probabilis-\\ntic insights. The blueprint also provides a foundation for\\ndeveloping nested architectures where reasoning structures\\nsuch as trees and graphs are embedded hierarchically. These\\ndesigns can address multi-layered reasoning tasks, expand-\\ning the scope of RLM applications to domains requiring\\ndeep, structured reasoning processes.\\nScalability remains a key focus of this work. The\\nblueprint’s modular design supports future scalable cloud\\ndeployments that enable efficient distribution of compute-\\nintensive tasks across cloud infrastructures. These deploy-\\nments will not only enhance scalability but also optimize\\ncost and resource utilization, making RLMs more accessible\\nfor real-world applications.\\nBy exploring and integrating these ideas, this work aims\\nto empower the next generation of reasoning language mod-\\nels, democratize access to advanced reasoning capabilities,\\nand foster innovation across research and industry. The\\nblueprint’s versatility, combined with the x1 platform, will\\nmake it one of the factors in the progress in RLM research\\nand applications.\\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\\nWe thank Nicolas Dickenmann for writing the initial MCTS\\ncodebase.

The MDP serves as\\na foundational formulation for modeling various types of\\nprocesses, and it can be applied to model reasoning chains,\\nwhich constitute the reasoning structure of the RLMs. Si-\\nmultaneously, MCTS serves as an efficient search algorithm\\nfor exploring and navigating the extensive space of possible\\nreasoning chains. The resulting state space is then used as\\na basis for modeling the RLM. An overview of the notation\\nused in this section is provided in Table 2.\\nA.1 Markov Decision Process\\nMarkov Decision Process (MDP) is defined as a 5-tuple\\nM = ( S, A, p, r, γ), where S is the state space, A is the\\naction space with As ⊆ Adenoting the set of actions which\\ncan be taken in the state s, p represents the dynamics of\\ntransitions between states, i.e., p : S × A × S →[0, 1] where\\np(s, a, s′) is the probability of transitioning to the state s′\\nwhen action a was selected in the state s, r : S ×A×S →R\\nis the reward function, i.e., r(s, a, s′) represents the reward\\nfor arriving in the state s′ after selecting the action a in the\\nstate s, and γ ∈ [0, 1] is a discount factor.\\nA.1.1 Solving an MDP\\nBefore stating what it means formally to solve an MDP , we\\nfirst need several definitions.\\nA trajectory τπ = (s0, a0, . . . , sT , aT , sT+1) is a sequence\\nof interleaved states and actions, selected according to the\\npolicy π (see below for the policy definition). Each trajectory\\nstarts at an initial state s0 ∈ Sand ends with sT+1 ∈ S\\nwhich represents the terminal state where no further actions\\ncan be taken.\\nA policy π(s) is a function assigning a probability\\ndistribution over the action space to a given state s; π :\\nS →∆(A) where ∆(A) is a set of probability distributions\\nover action space A. The expression π(a | s) denotes the\\nprobability of selecting the action a in the state s according\\nto the policy π.\\nState value function Vπ(st) represents the expected\\ncumulative future reward for a given state st under policy\\nπ:\\nVπ(st) = E\\n\" TX\\nk=t\\nγk−tr(sk, ak, sk+1) | st\\n#\\n(3)\\nwhere T is a predefined time-horizon. Note that, in order to\\nobtain the state sk+1, an action ak is first derived by sam-\\npling from a distributionπ(sk). Once the actionak is chosen,\\nthe environment dynamics p(sk+1 | sk, ak) determine the\\nprobability distribution of the next state sk+1.\\nTthe goal of solving an MDP is to find a policy π∗\\nwhich maximizes the value function as defined above for\\nall states s ∈ S, π∗ = arg max\\nπ\\nVπ (s)\\nThe State-Action value function Q(st, at) Oftentimes, it\\nis useful to use the state-action value function Q(st, at) in-\\nstead of the state value function. Specifically, the state-action\\nvalue function Q(st, at) extends the state value function so\\nthat the function value is defined on a state and a specific\\naction at:\\nQπ(st, at) = Eπ\\n\" TX\\nk=t\\nγk−tr(sk, ak, sk+1) | st, at\\n#\\n= r(st, at) + γEst+1 [Vπ(st+1) | st, at] ,\\nwhere Bellman’s equation is used in the second equality.\\nA.1.2 MDPs in the RLM Setting\\nIn the context of RLMs, a state s ∈ Sis typically defined as a\\nsequence of reasoning steps s = (z0 . . . zn), where each rea-\\nsoning step zi is a sequence of Mi tokens zi = (t0\\ni , . . . , tMi\\ni ).\\nEach tj\\ni is a token from the RLM’s vocabulary, and the total\\nnumber of tokens per reasoning step Mi can vary. One can\\nuse a special token tMi = tend to indicate the end of the\\nreasoning step. Typically, the initial query q is used as the\\nfirst reasoning step z0 = q. In the study of RLMs, an action\\na ∈ As usually represents appending a new reasoning step\\nz(a) to the current state s = (z0, ..., zn) resulting in a new\\nstate s′ =\\n\\x10\\nz0, ..., zn, z(a)\\n\\x11\\n. Since every action a is uniquely\\nassociated with exactly one reasoning step z(a) for every\\ns = (z0, ..., zn) and s′ = (z0, ..., zn, zn+1), we have\\np(s, a, s′) =\\n(\\n1 if zn+1 = z(a)\\n0 if zn+1 ̸= z(a)\\nThe definition of the reward function depends on the\\nspecific task. A reward commonly seen in reasoning tasks\\nassigns non-zero reward only in the terminal states and\\nhence only at the final reasoning step. This approach reflects\\nthe fact that for most tasks, the only final answer can be\\nevaluated against the ground-truth solution to the origi-\\nnal query. We call such reward functions sparse to clearly\\ndistinguish it from other setting in which intermediate\\nrewards can be observed by the algorithm in the non-\\nterminal states. The discount factorγ determines how future\\nrewards influence the current decision-making process. A\\nhigher discount factor ( γ → 1) places greater emphasis on\\nlong-term reasoning success, allowing the model to generate\\nlong reasoning sequences, while a lower discount factor\\nprioritizes immediate rewards, incentivizing faster progress\\nand shorter reasoning sequences.\\nIn the RLM setting, a trajectory τπ =\\n(s0, a0, . . . , sT , aT , sT+1) represents the progression of\\nstates st and actions at ending with a terminal state sT+1\\nin which no further reasoning steps can be added. The final\\nreasoning step contains the RLM’s answer to the original\\nquery.\\nThe policy π(a | s) in the context of RLMs defines\\nthe probability of selecting an action a that corresponds to\\nappending a reasoning step z(a) to the current reasoning\\nsequence represented by the state s. Since there exists a\\nbijective mapping f : A → Zbetween the action space A\\nand the reasoning step spaceZ, the probability distributions\\ncan be equated using the change of variables.

Examples include de-\\nsigns such as LLaMA-Berry [169], Marco-o1 [174], and po-\\ntentially OpenAI’s o3, which incorporate mechanisms like\\nexplicit MCTS combined with RL for decision-making. This\\nexplicit structure enables the model to simulate, evaluate,\\nand refine solutions iteratively, facilitating novel problem-\\nsolving and extrapolation. By separating reasoning from\\nthe static knowledge encoded in the weights, these models\\nachieve greater flexibility and interpretability in their rea-\\nsoning processes. Note that the explicit reasoning can be\\ninternalized via training making it implicit – we discuss it\\nlater in the blueprint.\\n3 E SSENCE OF REASONING LMS\\nWe now describe the general architecture of RLMs, which\\nwe summarize in Figure 4. In the following sections, we\\ngeneralize this description to the full RLM blueprint.\\n3.1 Basic Architecture, Pipelines, & Concepts\\nWe now outline the foundational architecture, operational\\npipelines, and core concepts. Figure 4 offers three levels of\\ndetail. In general (the top-left part), the whole RLM archi-\\ntecture consists of three main pipelines: inference, training,\\nand data generation. The inference serves user requests,\\nusing models (e.g., the value or policy model) provided by\\nthe training pipeline. Data generation mirrors the inference\\npipeline in its internal design; the main difference is that\\nit runs independently of the user requests, generating data\\nthat is then used to re-train the models. As such, training\\ncombined with data generation from various domains [121],\\n[168] offers self-learning capabilities and is analogous to the\\nself-play setting of AlphaZero [128].\\n3.1.1 Inference\\nThe inference process begins when the user provides an\\ninput prompt\\n1 , which typically describes the problem or\\nquestion to be addressed by the RLM. This input serves\\nas the root of the reasoning process and initiates the con-\\nstruction of a reasoning structure\\n2 that organizes RLM’s\\nprogress. The structure is usually represented as a tree.\\nThe root of this tree corresponds to the user’s input, and\\nsubsequent nodes are generated to explore the search space\\n– the domain of possible reasoning paths or solutions.\\nThe purpose of this reasoning structure is to systematically\\ninvestigate potential solutions, progressively refining and\\nextending reasoning paths to converge on an optimal or\\nsatisfactory answer.\\nAn individual point in the search space, represented as a\\nnode in the reasoning structure, corresponds to a reasoning\\nstep\\n3 . A reasoning step is defined as a coherent and\\nself-contained unit of thought – a sequence of tokens that\\nadvances the solution by either exploring a new branch of\\nthe problem or building upon existing progress. These steps\\nform the building blocks of the reasoning process.\\nThe details of how the structure evolves are usually\\ngoverned by the MCTS scheme , enhanced with policy\\nand value models (we also distinguish other reasoning\\nstrategies, described below). This approach, inspired by\\nmethods used in AlphaZero, ensures that the search process\\nis both efficient and directed toward promising solutions.\\nThe policy model\\n4 is responsible for generating new\\nreasoning steps at each node, predicting the next most\\nlikely and logical steps to expand the reasoning process.\\nMeanwhile, the value model\\n5 evaluates the quality of a\\nreasoning path starting at a given node, helping the system\\nprioritize the most promising steps to follow. Sometimes, a\\nreward model3\\n6 is used instead, to assess the quality of\\nan individual specific node and its corresponding reasoning\\nstep. In our blueprint, as detailed in the next section, we\\nabstract the models into a more general notion of operators\\n7\\nto enable more flexibility in how they are implemented.\\nThe search and reasoning processes continue iteratively\\nuntil a terminal step is reached\\n8 . This terminal step\\nrepresents a completion of the reasoning chain that forms\\nthe final answer to the posed problem. It serves as the leaf\\nnode in the tree, concluding that particular reasoning path.\\nThis architecture provides a unified framework that\\naccommodates a wide range of reasoning tasks. Whether\\nreasoning steps are fine-grained (e.g., individual token se-\\nquences) or coarse-grained (e.g., entire reasoning chains\\ntreated as single nodes), the architecture adapts seamlessly.\\nBy structuring the search space explicitly and guiding ex-\\nploration with policy and value models, the RLM achieves\\na level of reasoning capability bridging intuitive pattern\\nrecognition and deliberate problem-solving.\\nA detailed specification of the inference pipeline can be\\nfound in Appendix C.1 and in Algorithm 1.\\n3.1.2 Training\\nTraining details depend on what model is trained (value,\\npolicy, reward, ...). In general, we assume fine-tuning a\\nmodel such as Llama. Here, we follow an approach where\\none first harnesses supervised data, usually coming from\\nexisting datasets such as PRM800K [83]\\n1 , which becomes\\na part of the supervised training data\\n2 used in the su-\\npervised training pipeline\\n3 of the framework to train\\nsome, or all, of the models\\n4 considered in the blueprint.\\nThe second part of the overall training framework in RLMs\\nis the unsupervised (self-learning) training pipeline , in\\nwhich training data is being continually generated\\n5 and\\nused to improve the models.

Figure 2 shows an overview of the\\nhistory of the development of these models.\\n2.1 Basic Pillars of Reasoning LMs\\nThe development of reasoning-capable LLMs represents a\\nconvergence of three critical threads: (1) advances in LLMs\\nsuch as GPT-4, (2) RL designs such as AlphaZero, and (3)\\nHigh-Performance Computing (HPC) resources. Together,\\nthese threads have shaped models capable of efficient Sys-\\ntem 2 Thinking – a level of reasoning that combines explicit\\ndeliberation with novel problem-solving abilities, distinct\\nfrom the intuitive, fast, and automatic heuristics of System 1\\nThinking. Figure 2 compares example designs in these pillars\\nwhile Figure 3 (left side) further discusses the details of\\nthese pillars.\\n2.1.1 Large Language Models: A Reservoir of Knowledge\\nLLMs such as GPT-4o [109] or Llama [50] represent an\\nextraordinary leap in the field of AI, constituting a vast\\nrepository of world knowledge encoded directly in their\\nweights. Trained on huge corpora of text from diverse\\nsources, LLMs are capable of understanding and generating\\nhuman language with remarkable fluency. However, their\\nreasoning abilities largely align with the fast, automatic, and\\nintuitive System 1 Thinking. While they can generate co-\\nherent responses and even perform simple reasoning tasks,\\nLLMs have limitations. The reasoning they exhibit is often\\nshallow, rooted in the simple mechanism of predicting the\\nnext most probable token in a sequence rather than engag-\\ning in explicit problem-solving or structured analysis.

Land-\\nmark systems like AlphaZero [128] and a long line of others\\nsuch as AlphaGo [127] or MuZero [124] demonstrated the\\nprofound potential of RL by achieving superhuman per-\\nformance in games such as chess, shogi, and Go. Unlike\\ntraditional AI systems, AlphaZero began with no embedded\\ndomain knowledge. Instead, it mastered these games purely\\nthrough self-learning, discovering novel strategies that even\\nhuman experts had not considered.\\nOne of the most striking examples of RL’s innovative\\ncapacity came during an AlphaZero match, where the sys-\\ntem made a move initially deemed a mistake by human\\nobservers. This move [100] later proved to be both sur-\\nprising and strategically brilliant, illustrating the capacity\\nof RL agents to explore unconventional solutions that lie\\noutside the bounds of human intuition. Such capabilities are\\nfundamentally rooted in RL’s ability to navigate vast search\\nspaces effectively.\\nHowever, traditional RL systems lacked the ability to\\nencode real-world knowledge or handle complex, multi-\\nfaceted reasoning tasks. This limitation spurred the integra-\\ntion of RL principles with LLMs, combining the structured\\nexploration and optimization capabilities of RL with the\\nknowledge-rich reasoning foundation of language models.\\n2.1.3 HPC: Scalability & Efficiency\\nThe growth of LLM and RL systems has been propelled\\nby advancements in High-Performance Computing (HPC).\\nInitially driven by Moore’s Law, which enabled a doubling\\nof transistor density approximately every two years, HPC\\nbenefited from both technological advancements and the\\neconomic feasibility of manufacturing smaller transistors.\\nHowever, as the costs of further miniaturization have risen\\nsharply, Moore’s Law has reached practical limits, necessi-\\ntating alternative strategies like parallelism and heteroge-\\nneous computing.\\nModern HPC systems rely heavily on GPUs, TPUs,\\nand AI accelerators for their parallel processing capabil-\\nities, alongside CPUs for sequential and general-purpose\\ntasks. Heterogeneous computing leverages these compo-\\nnents to optimize task-specific performance. Distributed\\nframeworks, employing techniques such as data, model,\\nand pipeline parallelism [8], [12], [16], further enable the\\ntraining of enormous models across thousands of compute\\nnodes.\\nEnergy efficiency innovations, including sparsity, quanti-\\nzation, and pruning, mitigate the growing energy demands\\nof scaling AI systems. These advancements ensure that HPC\\nremains a cornerstone for developing and deploying AI\\nmodels, supporting the combination of vast knowledge, rea-\\nsoning capabilities, and computational scalability – allowing\\nAI evolution to continue beyond the limits of traditional\\nMoore’s Law scaling.\\n2.2 The Convergence: System 2 Thinking in AI\\nThe intersection of these three threads – LLMs, RL, and HPC\\n– has culminated in the emergence of models capable of\\nSystem 2 Thinking. These advanced systems combine the\\nknowledge-rich foundation of LLMs with the exploratory\\nand optimization capabilities of RL, all supported by the\\nscalability and performance of modern HPC. The result is a\\nnew class of AI models that can engage in explicit, deliberate\\nreasoning processes.\\nThese models possess a world model encoded in the\\nweights of their LLM components, allowing them to reason\\nabout complex scenarios and contexts. Their RL capabilities\\ncombined with the HPC capabilities enable them to navigate\\ntruly immense decision spaces, evaluate multiple strategies,\\nand iteratively refine solutions.\\n2.3 Interpolation (LLMs) vs. Extrapolation (RLMs)\\nStandard LLMs, driven by their autoregressive token pre-\\ndiction mechanism, primarily perform interpolation within\\nthe vast search space of solutions. They excel at generating\\nresponses that align with patterns seen in their training data,\\neffectively synthesizing knowledge from known contexts.\\nHowever, this process limits them to producing outputs that\\nremain within the boundaries of their training distribution.\\nIn contrast, reasoning LMs enable extrapolation beyond\\nthese boundaries. By combining structured exploration, rea-\\nsoning LMs navigate uncharted areas of the solution space,\\ngenerating novel insights and solutions that extend past the\\nlimits of their training data. This enables a shift from basic\\npattern completion to active problem-solving.\\n2.4 Hierarchy of Reasoning-Related Models\\nThe evolution of RLMs can be understood as a hierarchical\\nprogression, with earlier models such as GPT-4o being less\\ncapable in terms of reasoning, and the o1-like architectures\\ndemonstrating increasing sophistication and explicit reason-\\ning abilities. This hierarchy reflects the integration of System\\n1 (LLMs) and System 2 (RLMs) Thinking. RLMs can be\\nfurther divided based on how reasoning is implemented\\ninto Implicit RLMs and Explicit RLMs ; the details of this\\ncategorization can be found in Figure 3 (the right side).\\n2.4.1 Implicit Reasoning Models\\nIn this subclass, the reasoning structure is embedded\\nentirely within the model’s weights. Models such as\\nQwQ [140] operate as “black boxes”, where reasoning is im-\\nplicit and cannot be explicitly disentangled or manipulated.\\nWhile these models exhibit improved reasoning capabilities\\ncompared to standard LLMs, their reasoning processes are\\nopaque and rely on the internalized patterns learned during\\ntraining.', score=0.9346342, reference=PdfReference(type='pdf', pages=[4], file=FileModel(name='2501.11223.pdf', id='1f14e83e-4f8f-4d5c-ace0-226a01fdbaff', metadata={'type': 'paper'}, created_on='2025-01-23T13:19:39.620963343Z', updated_on='2025-01-23T13:20:28.265051503Z', status='Available', percent_done=1.0, signed_url='https://storage.googleapis.com/knowledge-prod-files/2beaa431-2ec0-4489-83b7-166d36e028ea%2F5bcf107f-a9d1-4982-af5c-0708c1147be0%2F1f14e83e-4f8f-4d5c-ace0-226a01fdbaff.pdf?X-Goog-Algorithm=GOOG4-RSA-SHA256&X-Goog-Credential=ke-prod-1%40pc-knowledge-prod.iam.gserviceaccount.com%2F20250123%2Fauto%2Fstorage%2Fgoog4_request&X-Goog-Date=20250123T133607Z&X-Goog-Expires=3600&X-Goog-SignedHeaders=host&response-content-disposition=inline&response-content-type=application%2Fpdf&X-Goog-Signature=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', error_message=None, size=7964667))), Snippet(type='text', content='6\\nTraining\\nData\\nGenera�on\\nSelf-Learning\\nImplicit\\nRLM\\n· Policy model\\n· Value model\\n· Supervised\\n  ﬁne-tuning data\\n· Replay buﬀer\\nModels are used to run inference\\nNew self-learning data is generated and used by training\\nuser\\nNew self-learning data is generated and used by training\\nUse updated models and buﬀer for data genera�on\\nData genera�on uses reasoning scheme\\nInference uses reasoning scheme\\nTraining\\nData\\nModels\\n(§4.3 -

MCTS iteratively\\nbuilds a search tree, representing the underlying MDP state-\\naction space, by aggregating the information obtained from\\nexecuted MDP trajectories. Let T = ( N, E) denote the\\nMCTS search tree where N ⊆ Sis the set of nodes and\\nE ⊆ N × A ×N is the set of directed edges between the\\nnodes. Every node in the MCTS search tree corresponds\\nto a single state in the MDP and every edge corresponds\\nto a single action. Every path from the root to the leaf of\\nthe search tree T corresponds to a single trajectory in the\\nunderlying MDP .\\nEdge statistics The MCTS algorithm stores the following\\nthree values for every edge s, ain the search tree:\\n• N(s, a) - the visit count of the edge (s, a) by the\\nalgorithm,\\n• q(s, a) - the estimated state action value of (s, a),\\n• r(s, a) = r(s, a, s′) - the reward received after taking\\nthe action a in the state s leading to the state s′,\\n• β(s, a) - the terminality function indicating if the action\\na leads to a terminal state.\\nThe Algorithm At the high level, the MCTS begins by\\ninitializing the tree with a single starting state s0 as a root\\nnode and performing the following three phases in a loop:\\n1) Selection - a leaf-node in the current tree is selected for\\nexpanding its child (children).\\n2) Expansion - if the selected node does not correspond\\nto a terminal state, it is expanded by taking an action\\n(or multiple actions) in the underlying MDP and by\\nadding the resulting state (states) to the tree as children\\nof the current node. A trajectory unroll is performed\\nfor every added node to obtain a reward. “Unroll”\\nrefers to simulating a sequence of steps from a newly\\nadded node in the tree down to a terminal state. This\\nsimulated trajectory represents a hypothetical path the\\nsystem might take if it continued from the current node.\\nOnce the simulation reaches a terminal state, a reward\\nvalue is calculated based on the outcome of that path.\\n3) Backpropagation - update the value estimates and the\\nvisit counts for the selected node and all its ancestors\\nbased on the obtained reward.\\nThe MCTS algorithm finishes when the stop criterion\\nsuch as the the number of iterations, the predefined com-\\nputational budget, or the convergence criterion is met.\\nAPPENDIX B\\nVALUE AND REWARD MODELS\\nWe now proceed to discuss details of value and reward\\nmodels.\\nB.1 Outcome-Based Reward Models (ORM)\\nvs. Process-Based Reward Models (PRM)\\nIn reinforcement learning environments, reward models\\nestimate the reward for taking an action a in state s which\\nleads to state s′. For reasoning tasks and algorithms like\\nMCTS, which rely on evaluating intermediate steps, it is\\nessential to have models capable of estimating the qual-\\nity of each step. Two primary families of reward models\\nfor such process-based tasks are Outcome-Based Reward\\nModels (ORMs) and Process-Based Reward Models (PRMs).\\nFigure 12 compares both classes of models.\\nOutcome-Based Reward Models (ORMs) , first intro-\\nduced by Uesato et al. [143], evaluate the reasoning process\\nsolely based on the final outcome. These models estimate the\\nreward of the final step in the chain, often modeled in the\\nliterature as the likelihood of a correct final answer given the\\nentire reasoning chain P(correct(zT+1) | z0, ..., zT+1) [83],\\n[143] where sT+1 := z0, ..., zT+1 is the complete reasoning\\nchain consisting of reasoning steps zi and T + 1 marks\\nthe last reasoning step.

Start by selecting the reasoning\\nstructure. Chains are the most affordable in terms of token\\ncosts, at least when it comes to ICL [14]. Trees, while\\nthe most expensive, offer rich branching that enhances\\nexploratory reasoning. Graphs, though slightly cheaper than\\ntrees, introduce additional challenges in implementation but\\ncan yield significant accuracy gains due to their flexibility.\\nNext, decide on the granularity of reasoning steps.\\nCoarse-grained steps, such as thoughts or sentences, are\\nwidely used due to their simplicity and ease of scaling.\\nHowever, token-based granularity, which operates at the\\nlevel of individual tokens, offers the potential for greater\\nprecision and unexplored accuracy improvements. This ap-\\nproach, while promising, demands significantly more com-\\nputational resources and careful design. This decision de-\\nfines your action space (possible operations) and state space\\n(configuration of the reasoning structure).\\nAnother decision is choosing a reasoning strategy to gov-\\nern how the reasoning structure evolves. MCTS combined\\nwith some variants of policy and value models remains the\\nmost widely adopted approach due to its balance of ex-\\nploration and exploitation. However, alternative strategies\\nthat have not been deeply studied, such as ensembles of\\nreasoning structures, may offer untapped potential.\\nFinally, determine the specific details of your chosen\\nstrategy, including parameters like exploration coefficients,\\ndecoding strategy, scoring functions, and step evaluation\\nmethods. These choices will significantly impact the model’s\\nreasoning dynamics, scalability, and overall effectiveness.\\nEach decision at this stage lays the foundation for tailoring\\nthe RLM to your specific application requirements.\\n6.2 Part 2: Define the Operators\\nThe next step is to specify the set of operators that will\\ngovern the reasoning process. For an MCTS-based design,\\nthe simplest approach is to implement the core operators:\\nGenerate (often called Expand for MCTS), Select, and Back-\\npropagate. These fundamental operations suffice for many\\nscenarios, providing a straightforward framework for rea-\\nsoning.\\nBeyond the basics, consider whether you want to incor-\\nporate less mainstream operators, such as Backtrack. By ex-\\nplicitly including Backtrack, you enable a clearer tracking of\\nprogress within the search tree, making it potentially easier\\nto revisit and refine earlier reasoning steps. This approach\\nalso facilitates advanced training schemes, like Trace-based\\nSupervision, by generating richer and more structured data.\\nConsider using this and other operators within our toolbox.\\nYou will also need to determine the implementation\\ndetails for each operator. Decide which operators will be\\nimplemented as neural models—such as using a policy\\nmodel to guide selection or a value model for backpropa-\\ngation—and which will rely on non-neural methods. This\\nchoice affects both the computational complexity and the\\nflexibility of the system, so it’s important to align these\\ndecisions with your reasoning scheme and performance\\ngoals.', score=0.75437254, reference=PdfReference(type='pdf', pages=[13], file=FileModel(name='2501.11223.pdf', id='1f14e83e-4f8f-4d5c-ace0-226a01fdbaff', metadata={'type': 'paper'}, created_on='2025-01-23T13:19:39.620963343Z', updated_on='2025-01-23T13:20:28.265051503Z', status='Available', percent_done=1.0, signed_url='https://storage.googleapis.com/knowledge-prod-files/2beaa431-2ec0-4489-83b7-166d36e028ea%2F5bcf107f-a9d1-4982-af5c-0708c1147be0%2F1f14e83e-4f8f-4d5c-ace0-226a01fdbaff.pdf?X-Goog-Algorithm=GOOG4-RSA-SHA256&X-Goog-Credential=ke-prod-1%40pc-knowledge-prod.iam.gserviceaccount.com%2F20250123%2Fauto%2Fstorage%2Fgoog4_request&X-Goog-Date=20250123T133607Z&X-Goog-Expires=3600&X-Goog-SignedHeaders=host&response-content-disposition=inline&response-content-type=application%2Fpdf&X-Goog-Signature=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', error_message=None, size=7964667))), Snippet(type='text', content='29\\ntransformed into rankings if needed, providing flexibility\\nacross various applications.\\nIn addition to numerical evaluations, there are text-\\nbased evaluations , which are commonly used to provide\\ndetailed feedback and guidance for refining reasoning steps.\\nExamples include “LLM-as-a-Judge” [176] (which uses a\\nlarger LLM to provide a pairwise comparison or a single\\ngraded answer with an explanation) and self-critique ap-\\nproaches [122] that allow models to reflect on and evalu-\\nate their own reasoning. These textual evaluations, often\\nincluding rationales, are particularly useful for structural\\ntransformations rather than numerical guidance, enhancing\\ninterpretability by offering context and detail.\\nB.4.2 Evaluation of Reasoning Steps\\nStep-wise evaluations are vital for integrating reason-\\ning into MCTS. Numerical evaluations-—whether relative\\nor absolute-—provide straightforward metrics to compare\\nnodes and steer exploitation and exploration. Text-based\\nevaluations, in contrast, are better suited for guiding struc-\\ntural refinements rather than directly influencing search\\npaths.\\nGiven that reasoning steps are typically textual se-\\nquences, language models are a natural fit for such evalua-\\ntion tasks. LLM-based approaches can involve external model\\napproaches, where a dedicated value model is trained to\\npredict scores, or internal model approaches, which leverage\\nexisting policy models.\\nExternal model approaches include value models that\\npredict scalar reward signals (Reward models) [34], [83],\\n[143], reinforcement learning values like state-values (V-\\nvalue models) [128], state-action values (q-value models), or\\npairwise models like the Bradley-Terry and PairRM frame-\\nworks. A more detailed comparison of reward models, v-\\nvalue, and q-value models can be found in Appendix B.3.2.\\nThere exist a large range of internal model approaches\\nas substitutes for value models. They typically rely on\\nmethods like prompting the policy to output scores. Exam-\\nples include MCT Self-Refine (MCTSr) [168], querying for a\\nbinary feedback (e.g., “Is the answer correct? answer“yes”\\nor “no””) [171] and evaluating the probability of the output,\\nleveraging uncertainty metrics such as token entropy or\\naggregated probabilities [174], and others [170].\\nHeuristics may also serve as substitutes for evaluations\\nin resource-constrained scenarios.\\nSimulating reasoning steps to terminal states for eval-\\nuation against golden answers is another option as done\\nfor example in MCTS, though often computationally pro-\\nhibitive.\\nExternal tools provide an alternative path for eval-\\nuation, especially in domain-specific tasks. For program-\\nming, compilers can supervise tasks, as seen in Codex [27],\\nself-debugging [30], and similar methods. Program-of-\\nThought [28] and Program-aided-Language (PAL) [48] use\\na formal language and Python interpreters to evaluate so-\\nlutions. In mathematical tasks, ensemble approaches like\\nMathPrompter [68] generate multiple algebraic expressions\\nor Python functions to validate steps. These tool-based\\napproaches excel at detecting errors due to their reliance\\non precise domain-specific rules, such as compilers for\\nprogramming or interpreters for mathematics. While their\\napplicability is limited to well-defined domains, they pro-\\nvide objective and verifiable feedback that complements\\nlanguage models. By injecting precise knowledge into the\\nevaluation process, external tools mitigate model-specific\\nlimitations like hallucinations and offer actionable feedback\\nfor iterative refinement. This hybrid approach enhances\\nreliability and ensures that the evaluation benefits from\\nboth the flexibility of language models and the precision\\nof formal systems.\\nAPPENDIX C\\nALGORITHMIC DESCRIPTIONS\\nC.1 Reasoning with Monte Carlo Tree Search\\nC.1.1 Setup and Notation\\nWe will now present the details of the training pipeline ofx1.\\nMDP Design x1 assumes the MDP following the definition\\npresented in Appendix A.1 with the γ values between\\n[0.95, 1] to avoid over-penalizing long reasoning sequences.\\nIn the RLM setup, the state space and action space of the\\nunderlying MDP constitute a tree in which every state s\\nother than the starting state s0 has exactly one action as\\nleading to it. This allows us to simplify the notation by\\nomitting actions wherever it’s clear from the context that\\nwe are referring to only action leading to a given. For every\\naction a leading from the state s to the state s′ we will write:\\nπ(s′ | s) := π(as′|s)\\nr(s′) := r(s, a, s′)\\nq(s′) := q(s, a).\\nτ := (s0, s1, . . . , sT+1)\\nThe final reasoning step in the terminal state contains\\nthe RLM’s answer to the original query. The final answer is\\ncompared to the ground truth solution, commonly referred\\nto as the golden answer. This matches the common setup in\\nmany reasoning tasks and math problems, where no ground\\ntruth and no reward source is available for the intermediate\\nreasoning steps.\\nConsider a trajectory τ := (s0, s1, . . . , sT+1). We assign a\\nreward of r(sT+1) = 1 if the last reasoning step in the final\\nstate sT+1 contains the correct answer and r(sT+1) = −1\\notherwise.

We use the notation of a node-edge-node relationship\\ndenoted by (s, a′, s′) where s represents the origin node,\\na′ describes the action corresponding to an edge, and s′\\ndenotes the target node. This notation symbolically ties the\\naction and the target state together, as the action uniquely', score=0.7320175, reference=PdfReference(type='pdf', pages=[29], file=FileModel(name='2501.11223.pdf', id='1f14e83e-4f8f-4d5c-ace0-226a01fdbaff', metadata={'type': 'paper'}, created_on='2025-01-23T13:19:39.620963343Z', updated_on='2025-01-23T13:20:28.265051503Z', status='Available', percent_done=1.0, signed_url='https://storage.googleapis.com/knowledge-prod-files/2beaa431-2ec0-4489-83b7-166d36e028ea%2F5bcf107f-a9d1-4982-af5c-0708c1147be0%2F1f14e83e-4f8f-4d5c-ace0-226a01fdbaff.pdf?X-Goog-Algorithm=GOOG4-RSA-SHA256&X-Goog-Credential=ke-prod-1%40pc-knowledge-prod.iam.gserviceaccount.com%2F20250123%2Fauto%2Fstorage%2Fgoog4_request&X-Goog-Date=20250123T133607Z&X-Goog-Expires=3600&X-Goog-SignedHeaders=host&response-content-disposition=inline&response-content-type=application%2Fpdf&X-Goog-Signature=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', error_message=None, size=7964667))), Snippet(type='text', content='16\\ngenerates\\nPhase 1 Training: Ini�alize models\\nAlternate between       and      to improve models (    ) and data (    )\\nPhase 2 Training: Reinforcement Learning\\nLLaMA 3.1\\nPolicy Model Value Model\\ngenerates\\nPolicy Model\\nSFT Training\\nMul�ple CoT examples\\nInput Output\\nInput Output\\nInput Output\\nMul�ple MCTS trees\\nInput\\nOutput\\nInput\\nOutput\\nInput\\nOutput\\nInput\\nOutput\\nInput\\nOutput\\nTraining Data Training Data\\n....\\\\\\\\eois..........\\\\\\\\eois........\\\\\\\\eois....... context + reasoning step + MCTS q-value\\ncontext + reasoning step + MCTS q-value\\n..\\\\\\\\eois.......\\\\\\\\eois..........\\\\\\\\eois...........\\n.......\\\\\\\\eois........\\\\\\\\eois.......\\\\\\\\eois......\\nLLaMA 3.1 TrainingLLaMA 3.1\\ncontext + reasoning step + MCTS q-value\\nStack of \\nlinear layers\\nalgorithmically insert \\n\\\\\\\\eois tokens between\\nreasoning steps\\nextract one training\\nsample per node\\nRL Training Data\\n(data generator)\\nInput\\nOutput\\nInput\\nOutput\\nPPO\\nTrainer\\nPolicy Server\\nBuﬀer\\nPolicy\\nModelbatched\\n& synced\\nMSE\\nTrainer\\nValue Server\\nValue\\nModel\\nTraining\\nData Genera�on\\nTraining\\nData Genera�on\\ncontext + reasoning step, advantage\\ncontext + reasoning step, q-value\\nnew reasoning step\\ncontext + reasoning step\\nvalue\\n1\\n1\\n2\\n2 2\\n2\\n1\\n1\\ncontext\\nFig. 6: An overview of the x1 framework is presented, highlighting its two-phase training process. In phase 1, the models are initialized, while in phase 2, the models\\nare iteratively refined by alternating between constructing a sufficient number of MCTS trees and training the models on data derived from these trees.\\n• Data Storage In the cloud, object storage provides auto-\\nmatic bandwidth scalability that allows scale computa-\\ntions operating on the same data. To overcome latency and\\npower constraints, data can also be placed in in-memory\\ncaches like Redis and hybrid solutions that combine disks\\nwith flash memory [172].\\n• Communication Requirements of the x1 blueprint differ\\nfrom classical microservices, that rely on high-level ab-\\nstractions like RPC and REST interfaces. RLM must uti-\\nlize high-performance network fabrics offered by modern\\nclouds, such as InfiniBand on Azure and Elastic Fab-\\nric Adapter (FBA) on AWS, both capable of achieving\\nthroughput of 400 Gb/s [39]. These are also available\\nto training processes distributed across many GPUs, e.g.,\\nthrough specializations of the NVIDIA collectives library\\nNCCL.\\n• Parallelism We apply parallelism at multiple blueprint\\nlevels, including the classic data, model, and pipeline\\nparallelism. These can scaled horizontally across a larger\\nnumber of virtual machines and containers. On the other\\nhand, reasoning steps can benefit from elastic scaling, like\\nin distributed MCTS and Beam Search, where each path\\ncan be explored in parallel. There, containers can be allo-\\ncated on the fly to support new paths and deallocated as\\nsoon as the parallelism scale of the computation decreases.\\nNew developments in the machine learning infrastruc-\\nture can significantly impact RLM deployment strategies:\\n• Elastic Compute Computing tasks can be executed on\\nephemeral resources that trade the guaranteed lifetime\\nand reliability for lower costs, such as spot virtual ma-\\nchines [101]. Serverless functions provide elasticity scal-\\nability with fine-grained pricing models [37], which can\\nbe a good fit for dynamically generated reasoning steps.\\nHowever, serverless functions are stateless and suffer\\nfrom cold starts, which requires optimization techniques\\ndedicated to LLMs [47]. Furthermore, restricted network\\ncommunication in functions forces the adoption of new\\ncommunication protocols [36], [70].\\n• GPU Management Cloud rental of GPU devices is partic-\\nularly expensive, and procuring a sufficient number of de-\\nvices can be challenging, specifically when constrained to\\na single cloud region. Given the large compute and mem-\\nory requirements of base models, space-sharing might\\nnot be feasible. On the other hand, time-sharing of GPU\\ndevices between different x1 services could be a viable\\nalternative, but it is currently constrained by large memory\\nallocations and the cost of swapping model checkpoints\\nbetween CPU and GPU memory. To increase resource\\nutilization, new techniques for efficient GPU checkpoint\\nand restore are needed [47].\\n• Parameter-Efficient Resource Sharing Resource-sharing\\ncan be further enhanced by utilizing a shared base model\\narchitecture for the policy and value models, while dy-\\nnamically swapping task-specific parameter layers - such\\nas Low-Rank Adaptation [62], prefix tuning [81], or other\\nadapter layers - on the GPU during inference. These\\nmodular strategies keep the base model loaded in device\\nmemory and replace only the lightweight task-specific\\nlayers, eliminating redundant loading and reducing both\\nlatency and memory usage. An example of an RLM, which\\nuses a shared base model with separate additional linear\\nlayers for policy and value model, is AlphaMath [23].\\n• Cross-Region Deployment Cloud applications are often\\ndeployed in a single region to avoid the performance and\\ncost of cross-region data access. However, workloads can\\nbe scheduled globally, suspended, and migrated across re-\\ngions to avoid hardware resource exhaustion and achieve\\nlower carbon emissions [33], [153].\\n7.6 Example Analysis: Token Probability Distributions\\nAs an illustrative example, we use the framework to directly\\nleverage the token probability distribution, thereby facilitating\\nthe use of associated properties—such as entropy and vari-\\nance—for guiding subsequent reasoning decisions.
